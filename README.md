### üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/utkarshkherwal/Stock-Price-Forecasting-Using-Machine-Learning--Nifty-50-.git
   cd Stock-Price-Forecasting-Using-Machine-Learning--Nifty-50-
   ```

2. **Run the notebook:**
   - Open [Stock_Price_Forecasting_Nifty50.ipynb](Final.ipynb) in Jupyter or Colab.

### ‚ö° Interactive Usage

- **Choose your stock:**  
  Change the `ticker` in the notebook (e.g., `RELIANCE.NS`, `TCS.NS`, etc.)

- **Adjust time window:**  
  Update the `window_size` variable to experiment with how much history to use for predictions.

- **Pick a model:**  
  Run model cells for Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost and compare results.

- **Visualize results:**  
  The notebook will generate plots and RMSE scores for each model.

### üìä What You'll Learn

- How to fetch and preprocess real Nifty 50 data with `yfinance`
- How to build, train, and test three classic machine learning models on time series data
- Why sometimes the simplest models (like Linear Regression) outperform more complex ones in financial forecasting
- How to interpret RMSE and compare model accuracy visually

### üìö Project Summary

This project aims to make stock price prediction approachable and practical for data scientists and retail investors alike.  
Surprisingly, for Nifty 50 stocks from 2019 onward, **Linear Regression** consistently produced the lowest RMSE, outperforming even advanced models like Random Forest and XGBoost.  
This demonstrates a key lesson: always start simple and validate with real data before reaching for complex solutions.
